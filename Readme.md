🔍 Revision Auditor
Revision Auditor is a standalone, Python-based desktop automation tool for tracking document revisions in manufacturing workflows. It audits Excel-based document lists against a Laserfiche web database to automatically detect updated or missing files.

It replaces legacy VBA macros with a robust Playwright automation engine, wrapped in a modern PyQt6 floating dashboard. It is designed to run daily audits for multiple product lines (Kinnex & Quattro) simultaneously.

✨ Features
🤖 Automated Web Scanning: Uses a headless Chromium browser to rapidly check hyperlinks. It intelligently detects "Entry Not Found" or "404" errors to identify revision changes.

🖥️ Floating Dashboard: A compact, "Always-on-Top" control panel allows users to start or abort audits without losing focus on the browser window.

📊 Batch Processing: Audits multiple product lines (Kinnex and Quattro) in a single session with a single login.

📑 Smart Reporting:

Highlighting: Automatically highlights dead links (new revisions) in Yellow.

Cleanup: Removes clickable hyperlinks and resets text formatting for a clean report.

Timestamping: Stamps the exact date and time of the audit on the final report.

🛡️ Safe & Robust:

Abort Function: Immediate "Kill Switch" to stop the process safely if the user needs to interrupt.

System Core Protection: Browser binaries are hidden in a protected system folder to prevent accidental deletion by end-users.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.13+

Automation: Playwright (Browser Engine)

GUI: PyQt6 (Floating Dashboard)

Data: OpenPyXL (Excel Read/Write)

Build: PyInstaller (Compiled to standalone .exe)

🚀 How to Install & Build
Because this app relies on a specific browser engine and local Excel files, it must be built correctly to run on other machines.

1. Prerequisites & Dependencies
System Requirement: Python 3.x installed.

Project Dependencies:

Bash

pip install playwright PyQt6 openpyxl pyinstaller
playwright install chromium
2. Building the Executable
To compile the app into a standalone .exe that hides the console window:

Bash

pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --noconsole --name "RevisionAuditor" --clean "audit_gui.py"
3. Deployment Structure
For the application to function on a network drive or another computer, the folder structure must look like this:

📂 RevisionAuditor Folder

📄 RevisionAuditor.exe (The compiled app)

📄 Kinnex Revision Source.xlsx (Input data)

📄 Quattro Revision Source.xlsx (Input data)

📁 _sys_core (Contains the Chromium browser binaries)

> Note: The _sys_core folder is simply the renamed browsers folder generated by Playwright. It should be set to "Hidden" in Windows Properties to prevent user tampering.
